MIST OF THE VALLEY - README

To run the program I have complied a file named --"Java 1 Final - Mist in the Valley.jar"-- and it will/should run when double-clicked.

Overall the game is about 95% complete, but one path is able to reach the end of the adventure.

To exit the app in the event that it doesn't on it's own, simply press 'ALT + F4'. 

I really hope you enjoy what I was able to accomplish given the setbacks I had.
